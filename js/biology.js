            <p>Imagine throwing a party so small that you‚Äôd need an electron microscope to attend. ü•≥ Welcome to the <strong>microscopic universe</strong> inside you! Every living thing‚Äîfrom the tiniest bacterium on your kitchen sponge to the tallest redwood tree‚Äîbegins with <strong>cells</strong>, the <em>fundamental structural, functional, and biological units of life</em>. Think of cells as microscopic cities, each with its own power plants, factories, waste management systems, and even security guards‚Ä¶ all working non-stop so you can blink, breathe, and binge-watch your favourite series. They are the smallest units capable of performing all processes necessary for life, often called the "building blocks of life."</p>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of an organism, typically microscopic, and enclosed by a membrane, containing genetic material and various organelles that perform specialized functions.</p>

            <h3>Major Categories of Cells</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prokaryotic Cells:</strong> The <em>minimalist pioneers</em> of life. They lack a nucleus and most membrane-bound organelles. Their DNA floats freely in the cytoplasm. Example: Bacteria and Archaea.<br><em>Analogy:</em> Like a food truck‚Äîcompact, self-sufficient, and efficient.</li>
                <li><strong>Eukaryotic Cells:</strong> The <em>high-rise complexes</em> of biology. They contain a membrane-bound <strong>nucleus</strong> and specialized <strong>organelles</strong> for different tasks:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mitochondria:</strong> Power plants generating ATP (energy).</li>
                        <li><strong>Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):</strong> Protein and lipid production centers (Rough ER with ribosomes makes proteins; Smooth ER synthesizes lipids).</li>
                        <li><strong>Golgi Apparatus:</strong> Packaging and shipping hub of the cell.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lysosomes:</strong> Waste management and recycling crew.</li>
                        <li><strong>Chloroplasts:</strong> (in plants) Solar panels converting sunlight into chemical energy via photosynthesis.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <em>Analogy:</em> Like a skyscraper where each floor handles a specific department‚Äîenergy, manufacturing, packaging, and security‚Äîall coordinated from the management office (nucleus).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cell Theory</h3>
            <p>The cell theory is a cornerstone of biology, stating that: (1) All living things are composed of one or more cells, (2) The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms, (3) All cells arise from pre-existing cells through cell division.</p>
            <h3>Cell Structure</h3>
            <p>Although cells differ in form and function, most share key components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cell Membrane:</strong> A protective barrier controlling the movement of substances in and out of the cell.</li>
                <li><strong>Cytoplasm:</strong> Gel-like fluid where cellular processes occur and organelles are suspended.</li>
                <li><strong>Nucleus:</strong> The command center containing DNA and directing cellular activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Ribosomes:</strong> Protein factories, either floating freely or attached to the ER.</li>
                <li><strong>Mitochondria:</strong> Energy generators converting food into ATP.</li>
                <li><strong>Chloroplasts:</strong> In plant cells, the site of photosynthesis.</li>
                <li><strong>Vacuoles:</strong> Storage sacs for water, nutrients, and waste.</li>
                <li><strong>Cell Wall:</strong> (in plants, fungi, bacteria) Rigid outer layer providing structure and support.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Types of Cells (by Function)</h3>
            <p>Cells can also be classified according to their role in the body:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Muscle Cells:</strong> Contract to produce movement.</li>
                <li><strong>Nerve Cells (Neurons):</strong> Transmit signals for communication.</li>
                <li><strong>Blood Cells:</strong> Red blood cells transport oxygen; white blood cells fight infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Epithelial Cells:</strong> Form protective layers and aid absorption.</li>
                <li><strong>Reproductive Cells:</strong> Sperm and egg cells for reproduction.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Functions of Cells</h3>
            <p>Cells perform a range of vital functions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Providing structure and support to the body.</li>
                <li>Facilitating growth through cell division.</li>
                <li>Producing energy via respiration or photosynthesis.</li>
                <li>Synthesizing proteins and enzymes for body processes.</li>
                <li>Transporting substances within and between cells.</li>
                <li>Removing waste products.</li>
                <li>Reproducing to maintain life continuity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cell Diversity and Specialization</h3>
            <p>Cells vary greatly in size, shape, and function. A nerve cell can be over a meter long, transmitting signals rapidly, while a red blood cell is small and disc-shaped to squeeze through capillaries. In multicellular organisms, cell specialization allows complex life to thrive.</p>
            <h3>Why Cells Matter</h3>
            <p>Without cells, life as we know it wouldn‚Äôt exist. Your heartbeat, your laughter, your ability to scroll this lesson‚Äîall of it depends on these tireless little workers. Every breath you take is powered by trillions of microscopic laborers who never go on strike. They adapt, repair, communicate, and replicate‚Äîan unending cycle of life. Respect them. In fact, the next time you feel lazy, remember your cells have been hustling since before you were born‚Ä¶ and they don‚Äôt even take weekends off.</p>
            <h3>Mind-Blowing Fact</h3>
            <p>If you uncoiled all the DNA in just <strong>one human cell</strong>, it would stretch to about <strong>2 meters</strong> long, yet it‚Äôs stored inside a nucleus smaller than a grain of sand. That‚Äôs like fitting a skyscraper into a shoebox‚Äîneatly!</p>
            <p><em>Closing Thought:</em> You are a living galaxy of 37 trillion cells, each a masterpiece of engineering. Next time you feel lazy, remind yourself‚Äîyour mitochondria are clocking overtime. So, give your cells the respect they deserve‚Ä¶ after all, without them, you‚Äôd be nothing more than an interesting pile of organic chemistry. üòè</p>
            <p>Now go forth, cellular commander, and appreciate the micro-marvels that make you‚Ä¶ you. And if anyone calls you lazy, tell them, ‚ÄúSpeak for yourself‚Äîmy mitochondria are doing overtime.‚Äù üòè</p>

        title: "Biology - Photosynthesis & Energy Flow",
        content: `
            <p>Imagine if your body could run directly on sunshine, skipping breakfast, lunch, and dinner entirely. üåû That‚Äôs exactly what plants, algae, and some bacteria do through <strong>photosynthesis</strong>‚Äîa process that transforms light energy into chemical energy. This remarkable ability forms the very foundation of life on Earth, fuelling food webs and driving ecosystems. Without it, we‚Äôd be in the dark‚Äîliterally and figuratively.</p>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Photosynthesis is the biochemical process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria use light energy, water, and carbon dioxide to produce glucose and oxygen. In essence, it is nature‚Äôs way of converting solar energy into usable chemical energy.</p>
            <img src="images/photosynthesis-diagram.png" alt="Photosynthesis Diagram" style="margin:15px 0; border-radius:8px;">
            <h3>Basic Equation of Photosynthesis</h3>
            <p><strong>6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O + light energy ‚Üí C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub></strong></p>
            <p>Carbon dioxide and water, in the presence of light and chlorophyll, produce glucose and oxygen.</p>
            <h3>Structure Involved in Photosynthesis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chloroplasts:</strong> Organelles containing chlorophyll where photosynthesis occurs.</li>
                <li><strong>Chlorophyll:</strong> The green pigment that captures light energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Thylakoids:</strong> Flattened sacs inside chloroplasts where light-dependent reactions take place.</li>
                <li><strong>Stroma:</strong> Fluid-filled space where light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) occur.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Stages of Photosynthesis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Light-Dependent Reactions:</strong> Occur in the thylakoid membranes, convert light energy into ATP and NADPH, and release oxygen as a by-product.</li>
                <li><strong>Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle):</strong> Occur in the stroma, use ATP and NADPH to fix carbon dioxide into glucose.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Energy Flow in Ecosystems</h3>
            <p>Photosynthesis is the primary gateway for energy entering the biosphere. Energy flows in one direction‚Äîfrom the sun to producers (plants), then to consumers (animals), and finally to decomposers. At each step, energy is lost as heat, making continuous energy input from the sun essential.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Producers (Autotrophs):</strong> Organisms that make their own food through photosynthesis.</li>
                <li><strong>Primary Consumers:</strong> Herbivores that feed on producers.</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary & Tertiary Consumers:</strong> Carnivores and omnivores that feed on other animals.</li>
                <li><strong>Decomposers:</strong> Break down dead organisms, recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Importance of Photosynthesis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Provides the oxygen we breathe.</li>
                <li>Forms the base of food chains and webs.</li>
                <li>Removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping regulate climate.</li>
                <li>Supports global energy flow and nutrient cycles.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Mind-Blowing Fact</h3>
            <p>The total energy captured by photosynthesis in one year is estimated to be over <strong>100 trillion watts</strong>‚Äîabout six times the current power consumption of human civilization.</p>
            <p><em>Closing Thought:</em> Every bite you eat and every breath you take owes a debt to photosynthesis. The next time you see a leaf basking in sunlight, remember‚Äîit‚Äôs not just relaxing, it‚Äôs working overtime to power the planet. üåø</p>

        title: "Biology - Genetics & Inheritance",
        content: `
            <p>Imagine receiving a recipe book at birth that contains instructions for building and running every part of you‚Äîhair color, blood type, even whether you can roll your tongue. üìú That‚Äôs the magic of <strong>genetics</strong>‚Äîthe study of how traits are passed from one generation to the next through the language of DNA. It‚Äôs like a biological lottery, except the numbers are A, T, C, and G.</p>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Genetics is the branch of biology concerned with heredity and variation in organisms. Inheritance refers to the process by which genetic information is transmitted from parents to offspring.</p>
            <img src="images/genetics-diagram.png" alt="Genetics Diagram" style="margin:15px 0; border-radius:8px;">
            <h3>The Genetic Material</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid):</strong> The molecule that carries genetic instructions. Its double-helix structure consists of nucleotides (adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine).</li>
                <li><strong>Genes:</strong> Segments of DNA that code for specific proteins, determining traits.</li>
                <li><strong>Chromosomes:</strong> Thread-like structures made of DNA and proteins, found in the nucleus. Humans have 46 (23 pairs).</li>
                <li><strong>RNA:</strong> A single-stranded molecule that helps in protein synthesis (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Patterns of Inheritance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mendelian Inheritance:</strong> Discovered by Gregor Mendel, includes dominant and recessive traits, segregation, and independent assortment.</li>
                <li><strong>Dominant Traits:</strong> Expressed if at least one dominant allele is present.</li>
                <li><strong>Recessive Traits:</strong> Expressed only when both alleles are recessive.</li>
                <li><strong>Co-dominance:</strong> Both alleles are expressed equally (e.g., AB blood type).</li>
                <li><strong>Incomplete Dominance:</strong> The heterozygote shows a blend of traits (e.g., pink flowers from red and white parents).</li>
                <li><strong>Polygenic Inheritance:</strong> Traits controlled by multiple genes (e.g., skin color, height).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Genotype & Phenotype</h3>
            <p><strong>Genotype:</strong> The genetic makeup of an organism (e.g., Aa). <strong>Phenotype:</strong> The observable traits resulting from the genotype and environment (e.g., brown eyes).</p>
            <h3>DNA to Trait ‚Äì The Central Dogma</h3>
            <p>Genetic information flows from DNA ‚Üí RNA ‚Üí Protein. DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which is translated into proteins that carry out cell functions and determine traits.</p>
            <h3>Mutations</h3>
            <p>Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence. They can be harmless, beneficial (driving evolution), or harmful (causing diseases like sickle-cell anemia).</p>
            <h3>Applications of Genetics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Forensic science (DNA fingerprinting).</li>
                <li>Medical research and genetic therapy.</li>
                <li>Agriculture (genetically modified crops).</li>
                <li>Understanding evolutionary relationships.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Mind-Blowing Fact</h3>
            <p>If all the DNA in your body were stretched out, it would reach to the Sun and back over 300 times‚Äîyet it‚Äôs packed into the microscopic nuclei of your cells. That‚Äôs like storing the entire Internet on a flash drive the size of a pinhead. üíæ</p>
            <p><em>Closing Thought:</em> Your genes tell a story that began billions of years ago and is still being written. While you can‚Äôt choose the script you‚Äôre given, you can choose how to perform it. So make your genetic story one worth remembering‚Ä¶ and maybe thank your parents for the good bits. üòâ</p>

        title: "Biology - Ecology & Conservation",
        content: `
            <p>Picture the Earth as a giant, interconnected web where every thread‚Äîplant, animal, microbe, and environment‚Äîis woven together. üåç That‚Äôs the realm of <strong>ecology</strong>‚Äîthe study of interactions between organisms and their surroundings. Add <strong>conservation</strong> and you get the effort to protect and sustain this delicate web, ensuring it remains intact for future generations.</p>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Ecology is the branch of biology that examines the relationships between living organisms, including humans, and their physical environment. Conservation is the responsible management of natural resources to prevent exploitation, degradation, and extinction.</p>
            <img src="images/ecology-diagram.png" alt="Ecology Diagram" style="margin:15px 0; border-radius:8px;">

                <li><strong>Community:</strong> All the different populations in an area.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecosystem:</strong> A community plus its non-living environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Biosphere:</strong> The global sum of all ecosystems.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Energy Flow in Ecosystems</h3>
            <p>Energy enters ecosystems primarily through photosynthesis, flows from producers to consumers to decomposers, and dissipates as heat at each trophic level. Unlike energy, matter cycles through ecosystems repeatedly.</p>
            <h3>Biogeochemical Cycles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Water Cycle:</strong> Movement of water through evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff.</li>

            <h3>Conservation Strategies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Habitat Protection:</strong> Establishing protected areas like national parks.</li>
                <li><strong>Restoration Ecology:</strong> Rehabilitating degraded habitats.</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainable Use:</strong> Managing resources to meet current needs without harming future supply.</li>
                <li><strong>Legislation & Policy:</strong> Laws such as the Endangered Species Act.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Threats to Biodiversity</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Habitat destruction and fragmentation.</li>
                <li>Pollution (air, water, soil).</li>
                <li>Overexploitation of species.</li>
                <li>Climate change and invasive species.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Importance of Conservation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintains ecosystem services like pollination, water purification, and climate regulation.</li>
                <li>Preserves genetic diversity for adaptation and resilience.</li>
                <li>Ensures sustainable resources for future generations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Mind-Blowing Fact</h3>
            <p>Tropical rainforests cover less than 2% of Earth‚Äôs surface yet house over 50% of all known species‚Äîlosing even a small area can erase thousands of unique organisms forever.</p>
            <p><em>Closing Thought:</em> In the book of life, every species is a page, and every ecosystem is a chapter. Tear out too many, and the story no longer makes sense. Our role? Be guardians of the library. üìö</p>

            <h3>Introduction to Immunology</h3>
            <p>Your immune system is your body‚Äôs personalized security force‚Äîfast, adaptive, and relentless against threats. It works in two main modes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Innate Immunity:</strong> The first line of defense; includes skin, mucous membranes, and immune cells like macrophages. Non-specific but rapid.</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptive Immunity:</strong> Specific and long-lasting defense; involves lymphocytes (B and T cells) that remember past infections for faster future responses.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Components of the Immune System</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>White Blood Cells (Leukocytes):</strong> Includes neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.</li>
                <li><strong>Antibodies:</strong> Proteins produced by B cells that bind specifically to antigens.</li>

                <li><strong>Attack:</strong> Pathogens are destroyed through phagocytosis, antibodies, or cytotoxic actions.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Formation:</strong> Adaptive immunity stores ‚Äúblueprints‚Äù for faster response in future encounters.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Microbiology & Immunology in Disease</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Infectious Diseases:</strong> Caused by pathogenic microbes (e.g., tuberculosis, malaria, COVID-19).</li>
                <li><strong>Autoimmune Diseases:</strong> Immune system mistakenly attacks the body (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis).</li>
                <li><strong>Immunodeficiency:</strong> Weak or absent immune function (e.g., AIDS).</li>
                <li><strong>Allergies:</strong> Hypersensitive immune responses to harmless substances.</li>

            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Neuroscience:</strong> The scientific study of the nervous system, including its structure, function, development, and disorders.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavior:</strong> The actions or reactions of an organism, often in response to internal or external stimuli.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Central Nervous System (CNS):</strong> The brain and spinal cord‚Äîcontrol center for processing and interpreting information.</li>
                <li><strong>Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):</strong> Nerves outside the CNS that connect the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Types of Neurons</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sensory Neurons:</strong> Carry information from sensory receptors to the CNS.</li>
                <li><strong>Motor Neurons:</strong> Transmit instructions from the CNS to muscles and glands.</li>
                <li><strong>Interneurons:</strong> Connect neurons within the CNS and integrate information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Neurotransmission ‚Äì How Neurons Communicate</h3>
            <p>Neurons send messages using both <strong>electrical impulses</strong> (action potentials) and <strong>chemical signals</strong> (neurotransmitters). The signal travels down the axon to the synapse, where neurotransmitters cross to the next neuron, muscle, or gland.</p>

            <img src="images/synapse-diagram.png" alt="Synaptic Transmission Diagram" style="margin:15px 0; border-radius:8px; max-width:100%;">

            <img src="images/brain-regions.png" alt="Brain Regions Diagram" style="margin:15px 0; border-radius:8px; max-width:100%;">

            <h3>Behavior & Neural Control</h3>
            <p>Behavior arises from the interaction of neural circuits, hormones, and environmental factors. The nervous system integrates sensory input, processes it, and coordinates responses‚Äîsometimes in milliseconds.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reflex Actions:</strong> Automatic responses controlled by the spinal cord (e.g., knee-jerk reflex).</li>

                <li><strong>Innate Behaviors:</strong> Hardwired actions present at birth (e.g., sucking reflex in babies).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Neuroplasticity ‚Äì The Brain‚Äôs Superpower</h3>
            <p>Neuroplasticity is the brain‚Äôs ability to reorganize itself by forming new connections. This allows learning, recovery from injury, and adaptation to new experiences‚Äîeven in adulthood.</p>

            <h3>Disorders of the Nervous System</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease:</strong> Progressive memory loss due to neuron degeneration.</li>

                <li>Neuroimaging techniques like fMRI to study brain activity.</li>
                <li>Cognitive-behavioral therapies for mental health.</li>
                <li>Neuropharmacology for developing new drugs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mind-Blowing Fact</h3>
            <p>Your brain contains about <strong>86 billion neurons</strong>‚Äîand each can form thousands of connections, creating trillions of possible pathways. In terms of complexity, it outshines any supercomputer on Earth.</p>

            <p><em>Closing Thought:</em> Neuroscience reveals that every thought, emotion, and movement is the product of an intricate dance between electrical sparks and chemical whispers. Behavior is not just what you do‚Äîit‚Äôs the final act of a microscopic drama playing out inside your head, every second of your life. ‚ö°</p>
